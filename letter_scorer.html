			<p class="modal-text">
				Every letter you send to a resident villager in the original Animal Crossing is internally scored to
				determine how a villager will respond.
				The scoring algorithm defaults to a point-based system, but changes to a rank-based system when you send
				a letter as part of a "quest" (i.e.
				when a villager specifically requests you to write to them). Type your letter's body text in the input
				field to see how your letter will be scored by the game! <br /><br />

				Toggle "quest" scoring by checking the QUEST checkbox. <br /><br />
				Mark whether your letter has a present attached by checking the PRESENT checkbox.<br /><br />

				Expand the "additional information" panel below the input field to learn more about how your selected
				scoring algorithm works!

				<b>Letter Scoring:</b> <br />
				Sending an unprompted letter to any resident villager will cause the letter's body to be scored through
				seven different checks. This letter scoring
				affects the villager's response letter, as well as your friendship with them and your odds at receiving
				a present in return!

				<br /><br />

				<b>Possible Outcomes:</b>
			<table class="letter-scoring">
				<tr>
					<td><b>Letter Score</b></td>
					<td><b>Villager Response</b></td>
					<td><b>Friendship Change</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>100 pts or more</td>
					<td>Positive reply <br /> 50% chance at receiving a random furniture / clothing item</td>
					<td>+3 if no present attached <br /> +6 if present attached</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>50-99 pts</td>
					<td>No reply</td>
					<td>+3 if no present attached <br /> +6 if present attached</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Less than 50 pts</td>
					<td>Negative reply</td>
					<td>-2 if no present attached <br /> +1 if present attached</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<br />

			<b>Check A: Punctuation</b><br />
			<small>
				Adds +20 pts if the letter ends with punctuation, so long as the letter body does not take up all 192
				characters.
				Also checks the next three characters following every occurrence of a punctuation mark. If there is a
				capital
				letter within those three characters, adds +10 pts per occurrence. If there isn't AND there is any other
				non-space character present,
				-10 pts per occurrence.
			</small>

			<br /> <br />

			<b>Check B: Trigrams</b><br />
			<small>
				Adds +3 pts per valid trigram found within the starting three characters of each word. A trigram is
				considered valid
				if it is found within the game's internal trigram tables.
				<b>
					<i>
						Note that these tables are bugged in the North American / Australian versions of the game,
						resulting in each trigram table being much longer than intended.
					</i>
				</b>
				This version of the tool does NOT take into account this bug and scores the letter as the game was supposed to.
			</small>

			<br /> <br />

			<b>Check C: Leading Capital</b><br />
			<small>
				Adds +20 pts if the first non-space character in the letter is a capital alphabetic letter; -10 pts if
				not.
			</small>

			<br /> <br />

			<b>Check D: Repeating Characters</b><br />
			<small>
				-50 pts if any letter of the alphabet is repeated sequentially three times or more.
			</small>

			<br /> <br />

			<b>Check E: Space Ratio</b><br />
			<small>
				If the ratio of spaces to non-space characters in the letter is greater than or equal to 20%, add +20
				pts. If the letter empty, all spaces, or is less than 20% spaces, then -20pts.
			</small>

			<br /> <br />

			<b>Check F: Run-on Sentence</b><br />
			<small>
				If the letter has at least one punctuation mark before the final 75 characters of the letter, check
				after each punctuation mark for an instance of 75 sequential characters without any punctuation. If
				there are 75 sequential characters without punctuation, then -150 pts.
			</small>

			<br /> <br />

			<b>Check G: 32-Character Space Groupings</b><br />
			<small>
				Checks every 32 sequential characters in the letter for at least one space. -20 pts per group of 32
				characters that does not have a space.
				This check does not occur if a grouping is not at least 32 characters long. For example, a letter 63
				characters long will only check the first
				grouping of 32 characters and will not care about the remaining 31 characters.

				<b>Quest Letters:</b> <br />
				Whenever you ask a villager if they need anything, there's a chance they will tell you that you should
				write a letter to them! This triggers the
				start of a questline where, if you mail a letter to a villager who has this quest active, a different
				ranking system is used instead of the normal scoring algorithm.
				This specific quest letter can rank between 0 and 11, with guaranteed rewards depending on your letter's
				rank.
				After mailing this letter, you can then talk to the villager again and your mailbox will update with a
				letter from them.
				If your letter ranked 3 or higher, this response letter will always have an attached present, which
				differs depending on the rank. The attached presents are
				consistent every time, meaning you can guarantee specific rewards if you pre-calculate your letter's
				rank! These rewards, and information about the quest-specific checks, are
				detailed below. <br /><br />

				<b>Quest Rewards:</b>
			<table class="letter-scoring">
				<tr>
					<td><b>Letter Rank</b></td>
					<td><b>Response Letter's Attached Present</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>0 - 2</td>
					<td>No attached gift</td>

				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>Random clothing item</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>Random furniture item</td>

				</tr>

					<td>Rare carpet or rare wallpaper (50% chance each)</td>
				</tr>

			<b>Length Check:</b> <br />
			<small>
				Quest letters have a length check that simply counts the total number of non-space characters in the
				letter. If there are 49 or more non-space characters, your letter
				gets +2 rank. If there are between 17 and 48 non-space characters, your letter gets +1 rank. Otherwise,
				you get no rank added.
			</small>

			<br /><br />

			<b>Trigram / Run-on Check:</b> <br />
			<small>
				This check calculates the total percentage of valid trigrams in your letter, as well as a special
				"run-on" check for repeated characters. A trigram is defined
				as the leading three characters of each word, and the game has an internal list of "valid" ones. This
				trigram check uses the same tables as the normal letter scoring,
				meaning this check is bugged in the North American / Australian versions of the game.
				The game calculates valid trigrams by getting the total number of words in the the letter and comparing
				it to the total number of valid trigrams.
				The actual calculation is:

				<code>    (VALID_TRIGRAMS * 10000) / (TOTAL_WORDS * 100) </code> <br /><br />

				Further, a letter is considered a "run-on" if any letter of the alphabet is sequentially repeated three
				times or more. The exceptions to this rule are
				these characters, which can be repeated sequentially up to seven times:

				<code>    ! " _ - ðŸ’¢ % @ Â· </code> <br /><br />

				After this, the check calculates the rank, which is best summarized via psuedocode:
				<pre>
          <code>
              RANK = 3

              if ( TOTAL_WORDS < 3 )
              {
                  if( TOTAL_NONSPACE_CHARACTERS < 5 )
                  {
                      RANK = 0
                  }
                  else if( RUN_ON == TRUE )
                  {
                      RANK = 0
                  }
              }
              else if ( VALID_TRIGRAMS >= 30% )
              {
                  RANK = 3
              }
              else if ( RUN_ON == TRUE )
              {
                  RANK = 0
              }

              return RANK
            </code>
          </pre>

				If you think this is programmed strangely, you are correct! Since this check defaults the rank to 3, you
				can purposefully write a letter
				to avoid the RANK = 0 conditions to still get +3 rank. An example of the easiest letter to write that
				gives +3 here is just "!!!!!"
			</small>

			<br /><br />

			<b>Present Check:</b> <br />
			<small>
				Simply adds +6 rank if you include a present in your letter.
